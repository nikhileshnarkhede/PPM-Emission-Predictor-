I worked with a dataset "emission.csv" containing the first-year average emission data for 10,000 vehicles and detailed technical specifications such as fuel, engine, gear, and navigation specifications. 
The goal was to build a robust model to predict the emissions (ppm) based on these technical features. 
I have utilized advanced machine learning techniques to extract meaningful relations from the technical specifications. Engineered relevant features to enhance model performance. 
I implemented a cutting-edge regression model by Bagging like ExtraTree and RandomForest and boosting like LGBMRegessor and catboostRegessor and then stacking the top performer model to predict ppm emission as a function of vehicle technical specifications. 
After rigorous training and optimization, I'm proud to announce that the model achieved an impressive R2 score of 0.980. 
This high accuracy indicates the model's ability to capture and explain 98% of the variability in the emission data. 
Reducing vehicle emissions is crucial for a sustainable future. 
By accurately predicting emissions based on technical specifications, we can make informed decisions to design and promote environmentally friendly vehicles.
